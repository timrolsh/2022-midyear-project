# 2022-midyear-project
Midyear project for AP Comp Sci, 2022. Online version of Alan R. Moon's board game, Ticket To Ride. 

Setup
- Score starts at 0 for each player
- Each player has 45 train cars of the same color
- 4 cards are given to each player. Each card is one color, and the color determines where you can place a train car. 
- The remaining cards stay near the board, and 5 cards from the top of this deck are placed face up.
- Longest path bonus card is placed at the top of the deck. 
- Each player gets three destination cards, and must keep a minimum of two cards. 
Turns
- Three options
  - Draw two train cards
     - If taken from the five face-up cards at the top, one wild card (rainbow) counts for two train cards
     - If there are no more train cards, players can only claim destination cards or claim routes. 
  - Claim a route. If you have enough train cards of that color to claim the route (e.g four green train cards are required to claim a green  route four cars long)
     - Claiming a route awards a certain number of points depending on length
     - The train cards get placed back into the deck
     - Gray cards can be claimed by any color card, and rainbow cards can claim any route. 
     - One player cannot claim both routes in a double route
  - Draw three destination cards, and keep a minimum of one
     - If less than three destination cards, take those that are remaining. 

When does the Game End?
- If a player has less than three cars, then each player gets one last turn and then scores are calculated

Score Calculation
- Add or subtract the score in a destination card depending on whether it was completed by the player
- The player who has the longest continuous path gets 10 extra points with a bonus card
- Player with most points wins, and for tie breakers player with most completed destinations wins
